# assemble node+edge dicts into a NetworkX graph, preserving edge direction
#
# Node deduplication — three layers:
#
# 1. Within a file (AST): each extractor tracks a `seen_ids` set. A node ID is
#    emitted at most once per file, so duplicate class/function definitions in
#    the same source file are collapsed to the first occurrence.
#
# 2. Between files (build): NetworkX G.add_node() is idempotent — calling it
#    twice with the same ID overwrites the attributes with the second call's
#    values. Nodes are added in extraction order (AST first, then semantic),
#    so if the same entity is extracted by both passes the semantic node
#    silently overwrites the AST node. This is intentional: semantic nodes
#    carry richer labels and cross-file context, while AST nodes have precise
#    source_location. If you need to change the priority, reorder extractions
#    passed to build().
#
# 3. Semantic merge (skill): before calling build(), the skill merges cached
#    and new semantic results using an explicit `seen` set keyed on node["id"],
#    so duplicates across cache hits and new extractions are resolved there
#    before any graph construction happens.
